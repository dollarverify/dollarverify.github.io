            <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
            <h3>Business Transactions</h3>
            <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be transferred.

            </p>
            <h3>Other legal requirements</h3>

            <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission over
                the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
